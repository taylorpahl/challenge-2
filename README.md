# challenge-2

## Description

This website sereves as a portfolio where employers can find projects that I have completed, links to my social media pages, and multiple ways to contact me. By building this webpage, I have increased my stock as a potential employee. Completing this project allowed me to learn how to build a website from scratch. I learned how to create and format code in a way that results in a presentable website by problem-solving on the fly.
