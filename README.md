# challenge-2

## Description

This website sereves as a portfolio where employers can find projects that I have completed, links to my social media pages, and multiple ways to contact me. By building this webpage, I have increased my stock as a potential employee. Completing this project allowed me to learn how to build a website from scratch. I learned how to create and format code in a way that results in a presentable website by problem-solving on the fly.

        Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

This webpage features links to projects I have completed, links to social media pages, links to my contact information, and navigation links to different areas of the website.
